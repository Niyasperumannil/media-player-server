json server-
------------
-json server lightweight easy to use node js tool that simulates a restful api using jaison file as the data source

-with json server frondend developers can create mock apis without the need of complex server side code . or when a backend api isn't ready yet

-How to create json server
---------------------------
1)create a folder for the server 
2)use command npm init -y- inorder to install package.file .
3)install all the libraries requred to set up the server
      -json server - npm i seerver / npm is json-server@0.17.4
      -it will create node modules as well as package.lock.json
4)To create .gitignore file - inorder to mention the file name which have to be ignored while pushing the code to git
5)create a file to store data with an extention as .json (content shold be json format)
6)create index.jsxfile - it is the only runs at the backend
      -edit script key with start command

       -index.js-
       -1)import json server liberary using require keyword
       2) create server using create() in jsonserver liberary
       3)set up port number for the server to run
              -process.env.PORT -access the available port for the server to run if the default is consume
         4)use the middleware to parse the json format default-method will return the middleware  
         middleware:- to perfoam activities by breaking/controlling the request response cylcle to convert data to perfoam applications   
          
        5)node mon to refresh the

 axios--
 ----------
 -axios is the promise based http clint node.js and the browser   
 -used two make trip http request between browser (frondend ) and the node .js environment (backend)
Content-type
syntax
-axios(config)
config = {
      method:value,
      url:value,
      data:value,
      headers:value
}
-how to set to content type of headers-

 1)application/json-if the body of the request contains only input data and hosted content
2)multipart/form-data-if the request body contains uploaded contents from the sysbel as well


side activities:-
-----------------
-those activities which effects the pure function are called side effect
-in react side effects are handled by using usebeffect hook
eg:-api call inside a component


use effect:-
syntax:-

-activitis perfoam by calling effect is given asthe first argument

useffect(()=>{

},dependancy)
-activities to be formed while calling effects is given as the first argument
-dependency -ehen the useffect have to be called 
-there are three types of dependency
1)no dependancy-useffect will be invoked in esach render
2)emplty array([]) -use effect is called in the first render
3)state/props:-useffect will be called in the first render and also when the state or props changes its value

state lifting:-
 -it is also used for sharing data
 -mechanisam of sharing data 
 -data display cheyunna sibling n stateum dataprovide chryunna sibling n statechange functionnum kodukum

 Intl.DateTimeFormat:- 
 object enables language-sensitive date and time formatting.
 
 syntax:-
 new Intl.DateTimeFormat(formate).format(time to be formated)

 path:-
 diffrent way of sending data 
 1)body parameter
 2)path parameter
 3)query parameter




 drag and drop machanisam
 -----------------------
 -dragable-they are attributes
 -droppable
 -ondragstart()-they are events- data is send using this event
 set data()- to function to share data
 -dragover()-to prevent data lose
 -ondrop()- to access
